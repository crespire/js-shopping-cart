# Shopping Cart Project

The start of the Odin Project shopping cart project.

The project utilizes:
* React testing via Testing Library
* A simple two route React Router
* Written using function components and hooks

### Next step
Figure out how to isolate overflow so that layout remains fixed, but "Display" area scrolls.
